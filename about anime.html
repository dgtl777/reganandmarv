    <h1>about anime</h1>
    <p>Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.[2] Compared
        to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.[2] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and
        features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes</p>
    <p>Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation.[14] Emakimono was common in the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left with chronological
        order, as a moving panorama.[14] Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China.[14] Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.</p>
